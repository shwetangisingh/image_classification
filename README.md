# image_classification
The MNIST dataset is one of the most common datasets used for image classification and accessible from many different sources. I have used sklearn dataset to load this mnist data.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images taken from American Census Bureau employees and American high school students [4]. Therefore, in the second line, I have separated these two groups as train and test and also separated the labels and the images. x_train and x_test parts contain greyscale RGB codes (from 0 to 255) while y_train and y_test parts contains labels from 0 to 9 which represents which number they actually are. To visualize these numbers, we can get help from matplotlib.
